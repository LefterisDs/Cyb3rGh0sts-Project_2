Welcome to the YS13 oasis! <\3

Over the past 5 years we've been evolving YS13 to fit a greater range of research activities
while also being in contact with fellow enterpreneurs who help us monetize and bring our goals
reality.

We have a long list of projects to get where we want, but our next priority is "Plan X":
that is, building an indoors greenhouse so that we can finally cultivate onions and avocados when we
send our initial colony on Saturn.

We are missing a "solar wind analyzer" to be able to proceed with this plan.
If you see this page and you have one, please bring it to the YS13 store and we will count you in as a project backer.

Love you big time!



PS1. Neat trick, run this (with the tor browser open) and you can access
foo.onion with a normal browser under http://localhost:8000

socat TCP4-LISTEN:8000,bind=127.0.0.1,fork SOCKS4A:localhost:foo.onion:80,socksport=9150



PS2. As always a big part of the YS13 mission is research. Reaching Saturn is not easy.
Lately we've been finishing the experiments for "Plan Y" which is finding the actual value of the ultimate coefficient.
Check the page below for some preliminary results. This is strictly for admins now so as to not
further destabilize the space-plant continuum.
